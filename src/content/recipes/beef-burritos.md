## Notes

- Reducing yogurt prevents excess free water and improves post-freeze structure.
- Gelatin remains sufficient to bind moisture despite lower dairy content.
- Lower filling mass per burrito improves wrap integrity and reheating consistency.
- Microwave + air fryer reheating restores exterior texture without drying the interior.
- Cheese dip under the street tortilla acts as an adhesive and moisture barrier.
- This version reflects **tested, real-world results**, not theoretical scaling.
