## Notes

- Cheese dip under the street tortilla acts as an adhesive layer and improves freeze–thaw texture.
- Seasoning is separated to allow flavour adjustment without compromising texture.
- Flour remains in the seasoning to ensure proper dispersion and prevent clumping.
- Gelatin and yogurt compensate for low fat and higher meat density per burrito.
- Beef filling firms on cooling due to gelatin; avoid over-reduction during simmering.
- Scale-based assembly is recommended for consistency.
