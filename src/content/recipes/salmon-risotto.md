Creamy risotto with pan-seared salmon, lemon zest, and edamame for added protein.

## Notes

- Lemon **zest**, not juice, preserves starch emulsion while adding perceived acidity.
- Edamame adds protein without starch dilution or sweetness.
- Butter is kept minimal; creaminess comes from rice starch.
- Salmon is added at the end to avoid fat emulsifying into the risotto and dulling acidity.
- This reheats acceptably once; further reheats degrade texture.
